## üí° Core Problem Solved

When local job seekers need employment or employers need to hire, they currently face overwhelming platforms where hundreds of applicants compete for single positions, making it nearly impossible to stand out or find quality matches. LocalHire removes this noise to ensure great local candidates and employers connect effectively.

## üöÄ Solutions We Own

| Solution | What it Solves | Guiding Principles |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Local Job Discovery** | Job seekers finding relevant opportunities in their immediate area without sifting through irrelevant distant positions. | Proximity-first / Community-focused |

| **Structured Profile System** | Resume bias based on formatting, ensuring evaluation is based on actual qualifications. | Data-driven / Standardized presentation |
